1- The Data
---------------

The Data is the hospitalizations of Federal District from year 2010 to 2018.

The Data is composed by 108 files with 37 columns, ~20 million of rows and 4.74GB size.

Only 9 columns was selected to analysis and the overall explanation for this is on columns_explanation.md file.

**Getting Data**

The Data was obtained from DataSUS (IT Health Department of Brazil), this sector is related to Ministry of Health of Brazil.

Link: [DataSUS](http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=0901&item=1&acao=25)

The files are formatted in (.dbc) which is the compressed form (.dbf) dBase III format.
I used the dbf2dbc.exe (Decompresser Program DBC to DBF), but due there were 108 files to process a batch script was created to deal with all files in a row.

The Batch script: 
```
for %%f in (*.dbc) do call dbf2dbc.exe %%f
```

After the processing, I've got each (.dbf) file and sent it to pandas Dataframe. This whole process is explained on notebooks.

2- Objectives
---------------------------------------------

- Analyze the relations between hospitalizations and public health institutions.
- Check and balance the origin of patients
- Correlate the costs of medical procedures and hospitalizations
- Predict the number of hospitalizations in 2019


<br />

3- Data Wrangling and Machine Learning
---------------------------------------------

The whole process of Data preparation and Machine Learning was explained on:
- PortuguÃªs (BR): [Notebook](hosp_analysis_PTBR_version.ipynb)
- English (US): [Notebook](hosp_analysis_US_version.ipynb)

<br />



4- Power BI and Visualization
---------------------------------------------

The DataSUS data about health institutions and medical procedures are only codes (numbers) which represent nothing to real world. I had to connect this numbers to real names of places and the procedures, that's why I've made a deep search on SUS (Unique Health System) for tabular data of Hospital names and procedures names from codes. As a result, this relationship model was created into Power BI:

<br />

The (INT_PROCEDS) is from original Dataset (INT_2010_to_2018), and also connected  with Group of Procedures(PROCED_GP) and Subgroup of Procedures(PROCED_SG), I've got a excel tabular data about this data containing the codes and the name of medical procedures, so I related the names with the codes on (INT_PROCEDS) to inform correct name to main dataset INT_2010_to_2018.

File: 

What's more, the same was done with (LISTA_CNES & CNES - Total de Unidades), I've connected the names with the health institutions codes (CNES) on main dataset (INT_2010_to_2018) to show correct names on graphs.

As a result, visualizations was made on Power BI from data in order to compare and get insights.
