<br />

1- The Data
---------------

The Data is the hospitalizations of Federal District from year 2010 to 2018.

The Data is composed by 108 files with 37 columns, ~20 million of rows and 4.74GB size.

Only 9 columns was selected to analysis and the overall explanation for this is on columns_explanation.md file.

**Getting Data**

The Data was obtained from DataSUS (IT Health Department of Brazil), this sector is related to Ministry of Health of Brazil.

Link: [DataSUS](http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=0901&item=1&acao=25)

The files are in (.dbc) format which is the compressed form (.dbf) dBase III format.
I used the dbf2dbc.exe (Decompresser Program DBC to DBF), but due there were 108 files to process a batch script was created to deal with all files in a row.

The Batch script: 
```
for %%f in (*.dbc) do call dbf2dbc.exe %%f
```

Link: [Program dbf2dbc explanation](http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=060805&item=6#dbf2dbc)

After the processing, I've got each (.dbf) file and sent it to pandas Dataframe. This whole process is explained on notebooks.

2- Objectives
---------------------------------------------

- Analyze the relations between hospitalizations and public health institutions.
- Check and balance the origin of patients
- Correlate the costs of medical procedures and hospitalizations
- Predict the number of hospitalizations in 2019


<br />

3- Data Wrangling and Machine Learning
---------------------------------------------

The whole process of Data preparation and Machine Learning was explained on:
- PortuguÃªs (BR): [Notebook](hosp_analysis_PTBR_version.ipynb)
- English (US): [Notebook](hosp_analysis_US_version.ipynb)

<br />



4- Power BI and Visualization
---------------------------------------------

The DataSUS data about health institutions and medical procedures are only codes (numbers) which doesn't represent the true names of organizations. I had to connect this numbers to real names of places and the procedures, that's why I've made a deep search on SUS (Unique Health System) for tabular data of Hospital names and procedures names from codes. As a result, this relationship model was created into Power BI:

<br />

The (INT_PROCEDS) is from original Dataset (INT_2010_to_2018.csv) created on Notebook, and so it was connected  with Group of Procedures(PROCED_GP) and Subgroup of Procedures(PROCED_SG). What's more, the same was done with (LISTA_CNES & CNES - T..), I've connected the names with the health institutions codes (CNES) on main dataset (INT_2010_to_2018) to show correct names on graphs.

- File 1: [Main Dataset](datasets/INT_2010_to_2018.rar) (.rar compressed format)
- File 2: [Main Procedures](datasets/INT_PROCEDS.rar) (.rar compressed format)
- File 3: [Group Procedures](datasets/GRUPO_PROCED.xlsx) (.xlsx excel file)
- File 4: [Subgroup Procedures](datasets/SUBGRUPO_PROCED.xlsx) (.xlsx excel file)
- File 5: [Main Dataset](datasets/INT_2010_to_2018.csv) 
- File 6: [Main Inst. Name](datasets/LISTA_CNES.csv)
- File 7: [Support Inst. Name](datasets/CNES.csv)

Some columns (Variables) was selected to connect the datasets:

- **PROCED_GP**: Informs the name of medical procedure (PROCED) to code (PROCED_GP) in (INT_PROCEDS.csv)
- **PROCED_SG**: Informs the name of medical procedure (PROCED) to code (PROCED_SG) in (INT_PROCEDS.csv)
- **NAIH**: Informs the procedures names (PROCED_SG & PROCED_GP) and total value (VALUE) to Main Dataset (INT_2010_to_2018.csv)
- **CNES**: Informs the name of health institution (Nome Fatasia, Establ. Saude) to Main Dataset (INT_2010_to_2018.csv)
- **DATE**: Informs the Monthly value of each Date to Main Dataset (INT_2010_to_2018.csv)

<br />

As a result, visualizations was made on Power BI from data in order to compare and get insights.
